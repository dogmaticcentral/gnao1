# Modeling the effect of GNAO1 mutations on the GPCR signaling cycle
GNAO1 is one of the key signaling proteins in the central nervous system. When the corresponding gene is mutated in an 
inborn genetic disease, two different groups of symptoms may occur: epilepsy or involuntary movements, 
sometimes appearing in the same patient. Even the symptoms from the same group sometimes respond to drugs having the 
opposite pharmacological effect. This capsule reproduces the main figures from
 [a publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/232058v1.full)
aiming to explain this puzzling system.

 
## How To Run
Click on the big blue 'Re-run' button to reproduce the main figures from the publication and the supplement of the
related publication.

## How to play with the code
Two file sin code/bngutils folder (literla.py and tweakables.py) contain the parametrization for the BopNetGen simulation.
You can make the tweaks there, or, if you are aiming for a larger exercise, fork the code on  [GitHub](https://github.com/dogmaticcentral/gnao1).
